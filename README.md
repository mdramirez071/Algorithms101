#This project is called Algorithms 101

The goal of this project was to accomplish the following:

Implement various types of Algorithms and write pseudocode in order to document the time and space complexities of each Algorithm.

How to Demo this project:

Clone the repository locally to your computer. Open up the project in Visual Studio Code.

Run #npm install.
